A snow-covered residential street in winter, with a thin layer of packed snow on the road. Tire tracks run along the length of the street, and large snowbanks are piled on both sides from plowing. A mix of houses line the street, including a white building with a sloped roof on the left. Trees in the distance include coniferous and leafless deciduous types. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, muted light across the scene. Utility poles with overhead wires follow the street, enhancing the suburban winter atmosphere.
